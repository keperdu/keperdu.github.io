        <p>I was born in Molepolole, a village 50 Km west of Gaborone.I attended my Primary schooling in Molepolole and my
        Junior High through university education in Gaborone.So where is Molepolole in relation to Botswana and Botswana in relation to Canada? Let's get a few things cleared up, Botswana
        is not and never was in South Africa. If it was we would have never needed to name it separately! It is not a province, not an extention
        and no, it is not "just the same thing". Now the confusion might arise because Botswana has been referred to as a country
        in <em>Southern Africa!</em>, the region! not South Africa the country. Get it now? ok, let's move on. This is the Republic of Botswana, see that very clear border between it and South Africa? Ok. I'll stop now, you get it!</p>
