<h1>MEET MARY </h1/>
<p>Most people who knew her knew why she didnt like phones.
 And most of them knew why she particularly hated phone calls.
 They also knew why, despite all that, she always has to be near her phone. 
 And why she has always has to answer every phone call. It all started with a phone call.</p>

<h3>Hopelessly Hopeful </h3>
<p style="color:red;">
 A single phone call changed her life in ways she could have never have imagined. 
They say bad news stops us for a while. Then you begin to move on. 
For Mary it was not bad news that stopped her. It was a monster far worse. 
The one that rears its head at the break of dawn and lets you hold on to its tail as the sun hits the western skies.Hope. 
And like a camel'd back it goes up and down.</p> 

<p style="background-color:Violet;">The phone call that delivered life shattering news to Mary brought with it some far worse than with it.
It brought hope with it. Every passing second of her life after that phone call she hoped against hope that she will see him again.
 She hoped he will see her again.<i> Would she recognise him if she saw him again. 
 Will he recognise her?</i></p>
