<h2>Meet Mary </h2/>
<p>Most people who knew her knew why she didnt like phones.
 And most of them knew why she particularly hated phone calls.
 They also knew why, despite all that, she always has to be near her phone. 
 And why she has always has to answer every phone call. It all started with a phone call.</p>

<h3>Hopelessly Hopeful </h3>
<p style="color:red;">
 A single phone call that chamged her life in ways she could never have imagined. 
They say bad news stops us for a while. Then you begin to move on. 
For Mary it was not bad news that stopped her. It was a monster far worse. 
The one that rears its head at the break of dawn and lets you hold on to its tail as the sun hits the western skies.Hope. 
And like a camel'd back it goes up and down.</p>

<p style="background-color:Violet;">The phone call that delivered life shattering news to Mary brought with it some far worse than with it.
It brought hope with it. Every passing second of her life after that phone call she hoped against hope that she will see him again.
 She hoped he will see her again.<i> Would she recognise him if she saw him again. 
 Will he recognise her?</i></p>

Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
He followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rule
It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school
And so the teacher turned him out
Turned him out, turned him out
And so the teacher turned him out
But still he lingered near
And waited patiently
Patiently, patiently
And wai-aited patiently
Til Mary did appear
Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go</div>
